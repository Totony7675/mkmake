## The MK Make Family

Welcome to **MK Make** (the Maragou-Király family Makes). We are an international family of makers living in Kapoly, Hungary.

We blend the **precision of modern technology** with the **warmth of traditional craftsmanship**, all while living sustainably and close to nature. Crafting methods used for generations are supported and enhanced with modern technology. 

High tech and tradition hand in hand: 
- a wooden piece carved on a CNC and finished with walnut oil from our trees, 
- a neon embedded in a hand planned walnut board, 
- the shape of a wood turned check piece verified with a 3d printed model...

We prioritize **locally sourced** products and material, and aim at preserving ressource, material and energy.

**Making makes us happy**, we mostly make items for our friends, family and for us. But we are now ready to share our craft with the world!

### Meet the Makers

#### Anthony
*The Techie Craftsman*

A former Telecom and IT **Engineer**, Anthony specializes in woodworking, wood turning, loves to build and tune machines, and constanstly experiments with new materials and techniques. Before coming to Hungary, Anthony was a **Fabmanager** at "Le Petit Fablab de Paris" for years.
He's a jack of all trade who tries to at least master some...

#### Erzsébet
*Craft aesthetics with a purpose*

Erzsébet loves to make decorative items from **natural material** (whool, seashells, wooden sticks, ...). Her drill press was a permanent fixture of our 1 bedroom appartment when we were living by the sea, to make jewelry from material collected on the sea shore.
Traditional needle felting and crochet integrate in other creations or get an **MK "twist"**, like her now locally famous magnetic cocardes.

#### The Next Generation

Our two daughters (ages 2 and 5) are already apprentices in their own right. Whether it's paper cutting, painting, plaster casting, or learning to handle a hammer safely, they are growing up understanding that **making is living**. When something breaks in the house, their first question is "how do we fix it"?
Soon they will teach us new techniques!
