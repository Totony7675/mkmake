## A peek behind the curtain

Here are some of our experiments, one off projects, equipment, favorite techniques. Pretty much any "making stories" of ours.

Our maker activity extends way beyong "The" workshop. We make everywhere: On the kitchen table, in bedrooms, in the garage, outside, and in daddy's messy woodworking workshop. Please don't judge me on the amount of wood shavings on the floor, or the pieces of wood lying everywhere cause they might be useful for something one day (they actually sometimes are!)

A big part of our journey is experimenting. We try, we fail, we try differently, we learn, over and over. The journey is more important than the destination!
